"R3DD1LBIROZV5C","Sheila Gallagher","Molly is a maid at the Regencey Grand Hotel.  She's different from everyone else who works there.  She takes her job seriously.  She is very conscientious.  When she goes to clean a room, it is spotless when she leaves.  She has been giving Juan Manuel, a dishwasher in the hotel's kitchen, a key card for a room every night so he won't be homeless since his work visa expired.  She has befriended Giselle Black, one of the hotel's clients.  On one of her cleaning jobs, she goes back to clean the bathroom of the Blacks suite which she had cleaned earlier to find the rooms a mess and Mr. Black dead.  What is she to do?  What happens when the police suspect her?This was not what I expected.  I loved it, but because Molly is different, I got so angry I cried as the police railroaded her.  I also cried as she relived things from her past especially her gran's death.  I was glad that she had friends to help her.  I also loved when she finally put things together in her mind and figured out who was friend and who was foe.  I absolutely loved the scene in court when Molly hit one out of the ballpark.  Molly sprinkled her gran's sayings throughout the story.  When she finally understands it all, she then knows what they meant.There were a lot of curves thrown my way as the story progressed.  I did not expect any of them.  I certainly did not have the killer right.  But in the end, I think everyone got what they deserved.  Molly is not someone I will forget.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 23, 2023","Loved it!",5,"","3"
"R3SHD8KJUB1JOT","Kindle Customer","The Maid is a wonderful character study that had me cheering on twenty-five-year-old hotel maid Molly Gray almost from the very first page. Daughter of a ""fly by night"" father and a drug addict mother, Molly was raised by her loving grandmother, herself a maid in a wealthy household. Upset whenever her chosen routine is ignored by others, Molly clings to the simple rules her grandmother gave her to navigate through a world she feels like an outsider in-- no matter how much she wants to belong.Molly's special blend of observation and naivete easily gets her into trouble, and several times I found myself mentally trying to steer her away from the people she's placing her trust in as well as trying to steer her toward the people she should trust. Unfortunately, my mental powers aren't very good and she seldom paid attention to me-- which means that The Maid is a much better book as a result.One of the best things about this book is the fact that, as I read, I became uncertain about Molly. Is she telling me everything? Can I trust her? My indecision made me read more carefully. Even though I only saw all the other characters through Molly's eyes, each one was vivid in my mind's eye, a testament to the author's skill. And, although this is a mystery, it's as a character study that The Maid shines brightly. I am so glad I met Molly and got to see the world through her eyes.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 16, 2022","Wonderful character study",4,"","40"

"R1P86BS3OHAZLW","Denise-Marie Martin","There is much to love about this slowly unwinding ""whodunit"" novel. Overall the book is a gem, a compulsive read, and a fantastic debut novel. Ms. Prose captured Molly's literal take on the world and her obsession with cleanliness to a believable T. But really, all the characters were well-developed and delightfully diverse. The plot kept me turning pages past my bedtime. The deceased grandmother's iconic sayings were a treat throughout Molly's flashbacks. SPOILER follows: I would have given the book a 5, except that the ""growth"" in Molly's character at the very end seemed to glorify deception and euthanasia.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 23, 2022","Amazing debut novel",4,"","6"

Interesting, well developed characters get me every time and this book is full of great characters. I won't reveal the end, but I never saw it coming.

I’m going through this right now in my own life. Molly learns to change her black and white view of life and make room for the shades of gray. She struggles with social skills (again, I can relate) and is able to make connections with people by the end. It’s marketed as a cozy mystery and the conclusion is kind of impossibly optimistic, but the message of being kind to others who are different from you makes this a book I can recommend to anyone.

I’m weird that way. The main character is a maid in a posh hotel. She’s invisible until she discovers a body in one of the rooms she cleans. (No, I haven’t ruined the story for you - the rest of the book revolves around this incident.) the Maid is charming and dedicated, proud, of her job and her place in the “posh” hotel. I enjoyed her innocence and trust in a world not so innocent and trustworthy.

"R2SAJ23R0CGW6Q","RSW Kindle Customer","This four-star thriller was a refreshingly fun read. Generally speaking, I get very annoyed by the “falsely accused” thrillers, but this one was so well done that it did not bother me at all, in fact I wholeheartedly enjoyed it.SUMMARYMolly Gray is a maid at a fancy boutique hotel. She absolutely loves her job and takes pride in doing it with meticulous excellence. Although Molly’s cleaning skills are top notch, she struggles with social skills. I think she may possibly fall on the spectrum somewhere. She tends to have trouble interpreting other peoples reactions and doesn’t seem to know what the appropriate thing is to say in many situations.One day, Molly finds one of the hotels most prominent guests dead in his hotel room. Since she was the person who found him, the police question her about the scene. Unfortunately for Molly, since she struggles with social skills and reading people, the police find some of her answers to be bazaar, suspicious and unsettling.Mollys grandmother, the one person who she can totally count on, recently passed away, leaving Molly struggling with both financial issues and having no one to confide in.Molly feels alone in the world, she has no one to turn to. Even though she had no involvement in the guests death, she finds herself getting and more entangled in the situation.WHAT I LOVEDThere is so much to love about this book. I think my favorite part of this book is Molly herself. Molly is the narrator of the book. It is all from her perspective. Hearing the situations from her unfiltered point of view with often hilarious. She misjudged many situations, which at times could be hilarious, at other times was kind of dangerous for her. I love the way she absolutely took pride in her job as a hotel made and was shocked that other people didn’t see it has the best job in the world. I loved her relationship with her grandmother. I just really loved everything about her.The plot itself was quite good. As I said earlier normally I hate “falsely accused thrillers,” but this one did not have that same feel to it.I read this book quickly because I could not put it down.WHAT I DIDN’T LOVEThere wasn’t a lot not to love, but there were a few things that I found a little odd. Not exactly real life. I don’t want to give too much away but one example has to do with the duties of an attorney. Just a few small things like that. But no big deal.OVERALLI totally wholeheartedly enjoyed this book and would be happy to read the next book written by Nita Prose.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 23, 2022","4 Stars",4,"","15"

"R2TR8Z0W37COQJ","Lindsay Worsham","First things first - I’ve seen some controversy floating around about Molly but let me say this: representation matters. It’s clear she is either neurodivergent or on the spectrum. I have talked with those who either are neurodivergent or have a loved one on the spectrum and thought the author handled this beautifully. I’m inclined to agree with them as well. Whether it’s a character like this, or someone with a visible disability like me, we WANT to see these characters in books. We WANT to be represented. So kudos to the author for putting Molly there. That being said..I just didn’t like the book. I just didn’t. I was bored. I would classify this more of a “it’s not you, it’s me” book though, because I truly think someone else could find joy out of it. It’s classified as a mystery, with the sub genre thriller, but I think the thriller genre does it a disservice because this definitely wasn’t a thriller. Grading it on mystery alone, I just didn’t care. It wasn’t enough to keep me hooked.What I did like was Molly. I love how the author described her relationship with her Gran and how this was such a loss when she passed away. I loved the friendship she formed with Giselle. I hated when people took advantage of her because of her condition, but I loved those that recognized it and took the extra time to explain the world - like Giselle. And I loved when Molly would stand up for herself to say that she mattered, regardless of occupation or how she was different.Again, it wasn’t for me, but it could be for someone else! I’m so excited to discuss it in book club!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 29, 2022","Could be for someone else, Wasn't the book for me",3,"","22"

For whatever reason, Molly has difficulty understanding the cues that others give when interacting. She certainly understands the difference between right and wrong, stands hard on the side of right, but is still led into a murder investigation as the primary suspect due to lack of her social awareness.Molly is aided in fighting the murder charges by a “family” of individuals who join together to prove her innocence. As the story nears its’ end, we find that Molly, like all of us, sometimes chooses the gray area between right and wrong in order to help good over evil.
